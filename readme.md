# Text Adventure!
This is a text adventure written in Python with the use of the Tkinter library. It was made for my IT class in the first semester of the year 2023-2024.

## How to play
You are in control of a human, to whom you must give commands through a text box. All possible commands are displayed to you, and once you've inputted you desired command you must press the [Act!] button or [Enter] on your keyboard to progress.<br>
If you must leave, it is possible to save your progress with the [Save & Exit] button.<br>
Currently, there are 5 attainable endings. Good luck!

## Extra features (that weren't mandatory)
- basic text input
- loading story from .json file
- custom font
- support for .gif images
- scaling images to set size
- saving and loading progress

## Sources
Most of the images and GIFs were taken straight from Google.com or Tenor.com search, but some were hand-crafted. And yes, the main character is John Egbert. Congrats, you managed to get him to leave the house for once.
